# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 28, 2026**

Sync ("we", "our", or "us") is a friend coordination app that helps you find overlapping availability and plan hangouts. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data We Collect

**Account information**
- Email address, display name, and username when you sign up
- Profile photo (optional, uploaded by you)
- City (optional)

**Availability and activity**
- Your weekly availability patterns and specific date overrides
- Travel periods you add
- Hangout history and activity tags you log

**Google Calendar (optional)**
- If you connect Google Calendar, we read your busy/free times to populate your availability automatically. We do not read event titles, descriptions, or attendees — only whether a time slot is busy.
- Google Calendar access can be revoked at any time from your profile settings or from your Google account at myaccount.google.com/permissions.

**Device information**
- Push notification token (if you grant notification permission), used only to send you hangout-related alerts

## How We Use Your Data
